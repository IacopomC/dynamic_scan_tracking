# Dynamic Scan Tracking Configuration
# 
# This file contains all configurable parameters for the dynamic LiDAR tracking system.
# The system uses dual parallel trackers (AST/ADT) with adaptive motion models.
# 
# For detailed explanations, see TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md

# Tracking algorithm parameters
tracking:
  search_radius: 0.2                   # Increased from 0.2 - larger search area during turns
  temporal_weight_decay: 0.000000005    # Gamma - exponential decay for temporal weighting  
  delta_t_pose: 0.01                    # Time delta for motion model (based on LiDAR frequency)
  max_pose_history: 100                 # Maximum number of poses to keep in memory

# Diagnostic parameters for troubleshooting tracking failures
diagnostics:
  enable_tracking_diagnostics: true     # Enable detailed tracking failure analysis
  min_points_warning: 5                 # Warn if object cloud has fewer points
  max_prediction_error: 2.0             # Warn if prediction error exceeds this (meters)
  velocity_change_threshold: 3.0        # Warn if velocity changes drastically (m/s)
  log_interval: 10                      # Log diagnostics every N frames

# Integration time parameters for dual tracking strategy
integration_time:
  # Adaptive Sparse Tracking (AST) - for close, fast-moving objects
  ast:
    min_integration_time: 1             # Increased from 1 - more stability
    max_integration_time: 5             # Increased from 5 - better accuracy during turns
    max_distance: 25.0                  # Maximum distance for AST in meters
  
  # Adaptive Dense Tracking (ADT) - for distant objects requiring more scans
  adt:
    min_integration_time: 5             # Reduced from 10 for better performance
    max_integration_time: 25            # Reduced from 50 for better performance
    max_distance: 60.0                  # Maximum distance for ADT in meters

# Kalman Filter parameters
kalman_filter:
  # Initial state covariance for velocity components
  initial_velocity_covariance:
    sigma_vx: 50.0                      # X velocity uncertainty
    sigma_vy: 50.0                      # Y velocity uncertainty  
    sigma_vz: 5.0                       # Z velocity uncertainty (typically smaller for ground vehicles)
  
  # Process noise (motion model uncertainty)
  process_noise:
    noise_a: 3.0                       # Increased from 2.0 - more agility for sharp turns
    noise_yaw_accel: 0.8                # Increased from 0.5 - faster turn rate adaptation
    # Higher values = more uncertainty in motion model, better for agile targets
    # Lower values = trust motion model more
    # Tune based on target agility and environmental conditions
  
  # Motion model configuration
  motion_model:
    type: "adaptive"                    # Motion model type: "cv", "ctrv", or "adaptive"
    turn_rate: 0.0                      # Default turn rate for CTRV model (rad/s) - only used when type="ctrv"
    use_adaptive: true                  # Legacy parameter - kept for backward compatibility
    turn_rate_threshold: 0.03           # Reduced from 0.05 - switch to CTRV earlier
    model_confidence_threshold: 0.2     # Reduced from 0.3 - use CTRV with lower confidence
  
  # Measurement noise (LiDAR accuracy)
  measurement_noise:
    sigma_x: 0.1                        # X position measurement noise
    sigma_y: 0.1                        # Y position measurement noise
    sigma_z: 0.1                        # Z position measurement noise

# Initial object position (used when drone_detection_enabled is false)
initial_position:
  x: 9.2 #10.52325
  y: -0.15 #-1.3305
  z: 0.4 #-0.3341

# Detection mode
detection:
  drone_detection_enabled: false        # If true, wait for initial position from /init_position topic
